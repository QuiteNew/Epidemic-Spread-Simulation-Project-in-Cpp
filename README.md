# Epidemic Spread Simulation Project in C++

### Project Explanation
The Epidemic Spread Simulation Project, firstly done created in <a href="https://github.com/QuiteNew/Computing-and-Algorithms-Project"><u>Flowgorithm</u></a> for the subject Computing and Algorithms can be expanded to a more complex project, including features such as complex epidemic spread models, interaction between people, and more user interaction. 
This project is for the subject Objective Programming

### Project Expansion Details
The epidemic spread simulation project will simulate the spread of a disease (virus) in a population over time. The disease will impact the population in different ways, depending on the rate of transmission, rate of recovery, and interaction between people. The simulation will include time-stepping to simulate the spread of the disease over multiple cycles (days or weeks). Users will be able to change parameters such as the infection rate, number of people initially infected, and other parameters. Core Features: Population Structure: The population will be made up of people, each of whom will have a status: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), or Recovered (R). Each person can change status from S to I (infection), and from I to R (recovery). The simulation will track these changes over time.

### Model of the simulation
Transmission & Recovery Model: Infection: Susceptible individuals become infected based on the infection rate (β). This depends on interactions with infected individuals. Recovery: Infected individuals recover over time based on a recovery rate (γ), moving from Infected (I) to Recovered (R) after a certain period. Interaction and Randomness: Simulate random interactions between individuals, where infected people can spread the disease to nearby susceptible individuals. Randomness can be implemented using random number generators to simulate the probability of infection transmission. Time-Stepping Simulation: The disease spreads and individuals recover over time. Each "time step" represents one day or one week of the simulation. You can choose how many days to simulate, and at each step, the population’s states are updated. Statistics Tracking: Track statistics such as: Total number of infected individuals over time. Total number of recovered individuals. Total number of susceptible individuals. Peak number of infected individuals during the simulation. End-point: when the epidemic is over, and the disease is no longer spreading (i.e., all infected individuals have recovered or there are no more susceptible individuals left). User Input & Controls: Users can set parameters like: Initial infected population. Infection rate (β). Recovery rate (γ).

Total population. Number of days to simulate. Maximum interactions per day (how many times people can interact with others). Allow users to modify these parameters during the simulation to see how different factors influence the spread of the disease. Algorithmic Breakdown: 1. Recursive Algorithm: The recursive algorithm is very important to simulate the passage of time (days or weeks). The simulation is based on discrete events—each day or week, the disease spreads, and people recover. Function Structure: The recursive algorithm will be responsible for the following: The states of people after each time step. Infection of susceptible people based on the number of infected people in the population.

### Algorithmic Breakdown
1. Recursive Algorithm: The recursive function is crucial to simulate the passage of time (days or weeks). The simulation is based on discrete events—each day or week, the disease spreads, and individuals recover. Function Structure: The recursive function will handle the following: Update the states of individuals after each time step. Simulate infection of susceptible individuals based on the number of infected individuals in the population. Simulate recovery of infected individuals. Sample Recursive Function (Conceptual): plaintext Copy code simulateEpidemic(day, susceptibleCount, infectedCount, recoveredCount, population) if day > maxDays then return end if # Infection spread (susceptible individuals become infected) for each individual in population do if individual is susceptible and random() < infectionRate then individual.state = infected infectedCount++ susceptibleCount-- end if end for # Recovery (infected individuals recover) for each individual in population do if individual is infected and random() < recoveryRate then individual.state = recovered recoveredCount++ infectedCount-- end if end for # Display the current status of the population print("Day ", day, "Infected: ", infectedCount, "Recovered: ", recoveredCount) # Recursive call for the next day simulateEpidemic(day + 1, susceptibleCount, infectedCount, recoveredCount, population) end function

2. Sorting Algorithm: Sorting can be used to rank individuals by their infection or recovery status. You can sort individuals by: Time of infection: Sort infected individuals based on the day they became infected. Most infected: Sort by the number of people infected by a particular individual. Sorting Example: Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort can be used to sort individuals based on infection or recovery time. You can display the top 5 most infected individuals or those who have the earliest recovery.

3. Search Algorithm: Search algorithms can help find specific individuals: Search for infected individuals: Find the first infected person or all infected people. Search for the first recovered individual: Find the first person to recover. Example: Linear Search: Traverse the population list to find individuals based on state (susceptible, infected, or recovered). 

### Simulation Workflow
Create a random population with a specified size. Specify the infection rate (β), recovery rate (γ), and initial conditions (number of infected). Initialize statistical counters (e.g., infected number, recovered number). Run the Simulation: For each "day" (time step), the simulation will: Determine if susceptible persons are infected according to random interactions. Process the recovery of infected persons according to a recovery rate. Update statistical counters (e.g., total infected, total recovered). Display Results: After each simulation step, display the number of infected, recovered, and susceptible persons. A summary could be displayed at the end with the maximum infection information, the total infected, and the time taken to "finish" the epidemic (when the number of infected is zero or when the system reaches a steady state). End Condition: Stop the simulation after a specified number of days or when the epidemic is over (when there are no more susceptible persons or no more infected persons).

### Important Notes
Taken from project assignment:
- Keep in mind the complexity of the project assignment. Because you are working a maximum of 3 people per project, all of the members need to complete at least 1 larger assignment in the group.
- The project needs to include the basic concepts that act as the building blocks of Object-oriented Programming (OP): Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, per group - decide among the members which student will work on what.
- The entire project assignment should be ONE whole project, meaning all of the work of each of the group members needs to be combined into one piece.
- All members of the group should contribute to the completion of the project.
- All members of the group should give an oral presentation of their working section of the project during the last week of classes (i.e., May 12/15, 2025).
